## Good code

### Solution #1: Use a button element
```html
{{ goodcode_one | pretty }}
```

Since the only purpose of this element is to trigger an action on the same page instead of navigation; the `<button></button>` element is the semantically correct element to use.


### Solution #2: Add a valid href value to the login form
```html
{{ goodcode_two | pretty }}
```

Another solution is to add a `href` value to a location where the same actions as the modal can be performed.
This provides a fallback for browsers and devices that do not support JavaScript. This is an example of progressive enhancement.
