## Issues and how to fix them

1. Links won't work, if JavaScript fails to load or execute.
1. You donâ€™t need JavaScript to link to other pages, you can use the `href` attribute for that. Browser support is pretty good (100% of all browsers).
1. The context menu on right click is different, "Open in new tab/window" is not available.
1. <kbd>CMD</kbd> + Click to open a link in the background won't work.
